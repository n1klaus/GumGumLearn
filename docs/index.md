Languages are immensely complicated structures. One soon realizes how complicated any language is when trying to learn it as a second language. If one tries to frame an exhaustive description of all the rules embodied in one’s language—the rules by means of which a native user is able to produce and understand an infinite number of correct well-formed sentences—one can easily appreciate the complexity of the knowledge that a child acquires while mastering a native vernacular. The descriptions of languages written so far are in most cases excellent as far as they go, but they still omit more than they contain of an explicit account of native users’ competence in their language, whether that language is English, Swahili, or Japanese Sign Language

### 💡Inspiration
This project was inspired by my need to track and learn new words i always encountered when reading books or in online publications. It was always easy to highlight on a hard cover but hard to recollect something that struck your mind at a particular time. After a shift to Pdfs and online books the hassle got easier but not completely eradicated. In the process of finishing up a book i always wanted to be able to apply some of the new words but i had no strategy for that. Hence later on i decided to create a key-value storage file to store words and their meanings and synonyms so that if i encountered for example two new  similar words I would be able to make the connection. With time i added features like pronunciation and translation up to this point where i have aggregated all that trial and error into a web application on a broader scope to help learners or people facing the same challenges and also with extra features.
