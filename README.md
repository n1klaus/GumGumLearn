# üßê Project philosophy

***Integration over Isolation***

GumGumLearn aims to provide the best way to learn, improve and gauge your English through persnoalized content fueled from yoour search queries hence making internalization and comprehension easier.

# üí° Inspiration

This project was inspired by my need to track and learn new words i always encountered when reading books or in online publications. It was always easy to highlight on a hard cover but hard to recollect something that struck your mind at a particular time. After a shift to Pdfs and online books the hassle got easier but not completely eradicated. In the process of finishing up a book i always wanted to be able to apply some of the new words but i had no strategy for that. Hence later on i decided to create a key-value storage file to store words and their meanings and synonyms so that if i encountered for example two new  similar words I would be able to make the connection. With time i added features like pronunciation and translation up to this point where i have aggregated all that trial and error into a web application on a broader scope to help learners or people facing the same challenges and also with extra features.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack GumGumLearn uses:

Database ‚Äî [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html) because of its popularity and recommendations from various blogs regarding speed, efficiency, full-text search capabilities, and also the PostgreSQL query cache

Back-end development ‚Äî [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3.8/) language due to simplicity and flexibility when learning and using new technologies and integration with command line tools for debugging and other alternative uses using CPython implementation, [FastAPI framework]() because of its straightforward documentation, performance advantages, and ease in building REST APIs

Front-end development ‚Äî [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) framework which provides several memoization techniques and the availability of vast technical blogs and resources to learn from
